Therefore, the amount of the

This disease is called as Asrigdara because Vaayu mix the Asrig (Rakta) in to
     the Raja by increasing its

Stana Roga

Reference:
S. Ni. 10,
S.Chi.17, M.
Ni. 66

Introduction:

Stana Roga are the diseases related to the female breast. Sus`hruta
     has explained that the causative factors of Stana Roga are same as
     of Gati or Naad`ee Roga. (S. Ni.10.15)This is Sootikaa
     Vis`hisht`a Vikaara. 



StanaRoga are not seen in the girls (who have never been pregnant) as
     the Stanasams`hrita Dhamanee_s are Samvrita (closed). Due to
     the closure of the Stanasams`hrita Dhamanee_s, Dosha cannot move or
     travel through them causing any Stana Roga. 
It means that after pregnancy and
     delivery of fetus only, StanaRoga are seen in the females as Stanasams`hrita
     Dhamanee get activated (they become Vivrita  open for
     movements of Dosha) and Dosha can travel through them.

S. Ni. 10.16-17


Stanya (breast milk) is the essence of the Rasa
     Dhaatu. It is Madhura and is formed from the completely
     digested food. This essence comes to the breasts (Stana) for the
     nourishment of the new born, therefore it is called as Stanya. Su.
     Ni. 10.18 (Stanabhavam Stanyam  Su. Ni. 10.18 Gayadaasa).


Sampraapti:

Dosha along with Stanya or without Stanya get harboured in to the Stana. They vitiated Rakta
     and Maamsa causing the Stana Roga. 



Stanarogaa_s resemble to the Vidradhi
     except Raktaja Vidradhi because Raktaja Stana Roga is not
     seen. M. Ni. 66.2 Madhukos`ha

Yonivyaapad

References: 
C. Chi. 30, S.
U. 38, A. H. Ni. 33

Introduction:

Birth of a child is dependent on
     female (Stree). A female is named as Stree in Sanskrit as
     she gives birth to the child. She (a female) is responsible for proper
     growth of fetus. Hence, any disease related to female reproductive organs
     lead to the damage to the progeny or infertility. Therefore, it becomes
     necessary to discuss about the diseases related to female reproductive
     organs. 



Vyaapad is called as derangement; therefore Yonivyaapad
     refers to the derangement of Yoni. Yoni refers to the female
     organs of generation. This derangement of Yoni is primarily caused
     by the vitiation of Vaata Dosha (Na hi Vaataad Rite
     Yonirnaarin`aam Sampradushyati).



Therefore, Yonivyaapad are
     the diseases related to female reproductive organs.



According to Sus`hruta, when
     a woman suffering from dryness, weakness or who is younger by age - a girl
     (Baala), when perform sexual act with a man having elongated penis,
     Vaayu gets aggravated. This aggravated Vaayu vitiates Yoni
     manifesting Yoniroga (Yonivyaapad) S. U. 38/3 



These are 20 conditions wherein S`hukra
     is not accepted by woman and the vaginal canal & all other
     reproductive organs are vitiated by Doshaa_s. Ultimately, there is
     no conception or there may be many diseases like Gulma, Ars`ha, Pradara
     etc. 



Unwholesome diet (Dusht`a
     Bhojana) is the main cause of Yonivyaapad. A. H. U. 33/27 


Synonym 
Yonigada C. Chi. 30/3-8 Chakrapaan`i; A.
H. U. 33/52
Yoniroga S. U. 38/1 D`alhan`a


There are basic
four causes of Yonivyaapad 


Mithyaachaara  This is unwholesome diet (Asamyag
Aahaara and Aachaara  C. Chi. 30/8 Chakrapaan`i).
Pradusht`a Aartava  This is vitiation of Aartava.
Beeja Dosha  This is vitiation of the Stree

Description of each Yonivyaapad

Vaatalaa Yonivyaapad 


Opinion of Charaka 

A female having
Vaata dominance constitution, Vaata gets aggravated when she
indulges in Vaata aggravating dietary and behavioral regimen in the Yoni.
This manifests with pain, stiffness of Yoni. There is feeling as if ants
are traveling over the skin. It leads with the roughness, numbness of Yoni
and other Vaataja diseases.
Menstrual blood
is flowed out with sound, pain. It becomes frothy (Saphena), thin (Tanu),
and dry (Rooksha). (C. Chi. 30/10) 


Opinion of Sus`hruta 

According to Sus`hruta,
there is roughness (Karkas`atva), numbness, and pain in the Yoni,
in Vaatalaa Yonivyaapad. (S. U. 38/11)


Opinion of Vaagbhat`a 

Vaagbhat`a has added symptoms as: In Vaatikee
Yonivyaapad, there is Arun`a (Slightly red), Krishn`a (Black)
Varn`a of menstrual blood and in less quantity (Alpa). There is
uterine prolapse (Yoni Bhrams`ha). There is pain in the groin region and
in the flanks and successively it leads to the Gulma (Raktaja). (A.
H. U. 33/29-31)

Pittalaa Yonivyaapad



Opinion of Charaka and Vaagbhat`a

Indulgence in
consuming pungent (Kat`u), salty (Lavan`a) and alkaline (Kshaara)
food stuffs leads to aggravation of Pitta. It manifests with systemic
symptoms like burning sensation (Daaha), fever (Jvara). Menstrual
blood turns to dark blue, black or yellow colour. There is heavy flow of
menstrual blood. It becomes hot and with foul smell. (C. Chi. 30/11-12; A. H.
U. 33/43)


Opinion of Sus`hruta 

According to Sus`hruta,
there is burning sensation in Yoni, there is Paaka and there is Jvara.
This is Pittalaa Yoni. (S. U. 38/14)


S`hleshmalaa Yonivyaapad



Opinion of Charaka and Vaagbhat`a

Kapha gets aggravated due to consumption of
slimy (Abhishyandee) food. It vitiates Yoni making it Pichchhila
(Sticky), cold and with itching. There is relatively less pain. The menstrual
blood turns to have stickiness and whitish colour. (C. Chi. 30/13; A. H. U. 33/44)


Opinion of Sus`hruta 

According to Sus`hruta,
Yoni becomes sticky (Pichchhila) and temperature goes down, it becomes
cold. There is itching also. This is S`hleshmalaa Yonivyaapad. (S. U.
38/17)



Saannipaatika Yonivyaapad



Opinion of Charaka and Vaagbhat`a

All the three Doshaa_s
are aggravated by consumption of food having all the six tastes. They vitiate Yoni
and Garbhaas`haya (Uterus). This Yonivyaapad manifests with
burning sensation (Daaha), pain (S`hoola). The menstrual blood
becomes white and sticky (Pichchhila).( C. Chi. 30/14-15; A. H. U.
33/51)


Opinion of Sus`hruta 

This is called
as Sarvajaa Yonivyaapad by Sus`hruta. In Sannipaatajaa
Yonivyaapad, there is manifestation of symptoms due to all the Dosha.
This is incurable. 
(S. U. 38/19, 20)

Asrijaa (Aprajaa)
Yonivyaapad 


Opinion of Charaka 


Labdhe
Garbhe Api Raktam Atipravartate, Ten Asyaa Garbho Na Tisht`hati; Sa Asrijaa Raktayoinh Iti
Arthah | Chakrapaan`i

When a
conceived woman consumes Rakta and Pitta aggravating diet,
aggravated Pitta vitiates Rakta. This vitiated Rakta flows
out through vagina. This causes miscarriage or abortion. This is Asrijaa
Yonivyaapad. (C. Chi. 30/16)


Opinion of Vaagbhat`a

Vaagbhat`a has not pointed out the pregnant state
of a woman; but only said that there is excessive blood loss through vagina in Raktayoni.
(A. H. U. 33/43)

Arajaskaa (Anaartavaa) Yonivyaapad



Opinion of Charaka 


Arajaskaa
Iti Anaartavaa | Chakrapaan`i

Pitta residing at Yoni and Garbhaas`haya
(uterus) vitiates Rakta (Aartava). This manifests in Kaars`hya
(emaciation) and Vivarn`atva. 
There is loss
of menstruation; therefore it is called as Arajaskaa Yonivyaapad. (C.
Chi. 30/16)


Opinion of Sus`hruta 

According to Sus`hruta,
there is loss of menstruation (Nasht`a Aartava) and there is pain. This
is Vandhyaa Yoni. (S. U. 38/10)

Acharan`aa Yonivyaapad



Opinion of Charaka and Vaagbhat`a
