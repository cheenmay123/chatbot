Vaata Eva
Vyaadhi Vaatavyaadhih |
Vaata itself is treated as Vyaadhi considering its potential to cause Vyaadhi with dominance of Vaata.
Here, Vaata itself acts as a Dooshya and manifests diseases all over
the body or locally.

Any disease which is caused due to the dominance of
Vaata Dosha, is Vaatavyaadhi.

Introduction:


Vaata is main entity as Dosha in the human body. It is the most potent Dosha as many activities of other Dosha are dependent on it. Jvara and other Vyaadhi are also caused by Vaata Dosha also, but they are not
     denoted as Vaatavyaadhi, because
     other Dosha like Pitta and Kapha both are equally involved, in the pathogenesis of Jvara etc. diseases. But in the Vaatavyaadhi pathogenesis and
     manifestation the major role is of Vaata
     Dosha. Other Aavrita Vikaara
     like Kaphaavrita and Pittaavrita Vaata etc. are
     considered under Vaatavyaadhi because
     there is major involvement of Vaata
     Dosha than other Dosha. 



Vaata is Atibala,
     Aas`hukaaree, Gariyas i. e. it is the most potent and powerful Dosha by which other Dosha; i.e. Kapha and Pitta are
     influenced. As the Vaatavyaadhi
     are difficult to cure and have specific treatment, they are described
     separately. But it is not so with the Pittavikaara
     and Kaphavikaara so they are not
     described separately. 



It is very difficult to describe all the Vaatavyaadhi as there can be
     innumerable combinations depending upon the site, vitiation of Vaata type etc. Therefore these are
     to be judged according to the site and the symptoms which are manifested. 



The prime Dosha
     in the pathogenesis of Vaatavyaadhi is
     Vaata, but it is also necessary
     to find out the association of other two Dosha with the help of the symptoms. 



Vaata gets aggravated due to two major causes:

Dhaatu Kshaya
Maargaavaran`a


Vaata is the most potent Dosha. Being Sookshma (subtle),
     Vaata moves all over the body
     and vitiates other Dosha. This
     leads to the diseases at the site at which the Dosha are aggravated. It also causes emaciation of Dhaatu. 



Charaka
     Samhitaa has given the 5
     types of Vaata Dosha according
     to Sthaana (site) and Kriyaa (Vaata responsible for different actions). They are Praan`a, Udaana, Samaana, Vyaana,
     Samaana, Apaana. When the actions of specific type of Vaata is aggravated or diminished,
     it is to be taken as a vitiation of Vaata.
     Actually, 80 types of Naanaatmaja
     Vikaaraa are explained in Sootrasthaana
     of Charaka Samhitaa.

     Dosha 


Praan`a When vitiated causes the diseases like Hikkaa, S`hvaasa, Kaasa. 
Udaana When vitiated causes the upperclavicular diseases
(OordhvaJatrugata Vikaara)
Samaana When vitiated cuases diseases like Gulma, Agnisaada, Atisaara, etc.
Vyaana When vitiated leads to the diseases manifesting
all over the body; S`hukradosha, Prameha
etc.
Apaana When vitiated leads to the diseases related to Basti and Guda; S`hukradosha, Prameha.
