The
disease caused by vitiation of Vaata and Rakta is Vaatarakta.
There is dominance of Vaayu and not of Rakta; so it is not named
as Raktavaata. 

Types 
According to sites:

Uttaana (Anavagaad`ha)
Gambheera (Avagaad`ha)
Ubhayaas`hrayee
     (Uttana + Avagaad`ha)


According to Dosha

Vaataja
Pattaja
Kaphaja
Raktaja
Vaata Pittaja
Vaata Kaphaja
Kapha Pittaja
Saannipaatika


Though it has explained as
Uttaana and Gambheera, Sus`hruta says that Vaatarakta like
Kusht`ha turns into Avagaad`ha after Uttaana stage.
Therefore, it is not necessary to describe it two types. Su.Chi.5/3

Sukumaara, people indulged in unwholesome diet or obese,
living happily such types of person are more prone to have Vaatarakta. Su.Chi.5/5

Sampraapti: 
Trauma, As`huddhi (not performing Panchakarma
therapy), swimming, walking in sun heat, suppressing natural urges, etc. lead
to the aggravation of Vaayu. 
This aggravated Vaayu gets covered by Rakta
(Aavaran`a)
It vitiates Rakta. 
Vaayu
is Sookshma and Sara (it traverses through the body). Rakta is
Drava (liquid) and Sara. They both traverse through the Siraa
and affect the inter-phalangeal joints. They cause the deformity in the joints
and the joints get crooked. 
There the symptoms are manifested according to the
association of Dosha. Generally, the pains are manifested in the joints
and this pain is very serious and intolerable.


Lakshan`a
(Clinical presentation):
It shows severe pain with
other symptoms like burning, redness etc.
The start of the pain is
at the root of the feet (metacarpal joints, ankle joint etc.) as accumulation
of the blood starts from the joints of the feet. It may also starts from the
joints of the hands also. It spreads in the body like rat poison as it
stabilizes at a place and then spreads all over the body. It does not spread
fast. 
Vaatarakta is manifested with the symptoms like Kusht`ha.


In VaataRakta the
successive Dhaatu from Maamsa are vitiated and it turns it to the
Gambheera VaataRakta Avasthaa. 

Sites of Vaatarakta manifestation:
Hands, feet, fingers and all
the joints are sites of manifestation. At the onset Vaatarakta is
manifested on the hands and feet, and then it spreads all over the body.

Vaatarakta is a disease in which channel of Rakta Dhaatu
is obstructed by Vaayu and the movements of Vaayu are obstructed
by Rakta; which leads to this serious and acute condition. If Vaatarakta
is untreated it leads to Vikalataa. 

Difference between Raktagata Vaata and Vaatarakta 
(M.N.23
Madhukos`ha)
In Raktagata Vaata;
only Vaayu is vitiated and not the Dhaatu Rakta. But in Vaata
Rakta, both are vitiated and vitiate each other causing the symptoms like
severe pain, burning sensation.
