Mythological aspect: 
When the
churning of ocean (Samudra Manthana) was
carried out by Gods and demons to get the nectar / ambrosia; there evolved the
frightful man (Ghora Purusha) before
evolution of nectar. 
After looking
at him, the entire world turned in to sorrowful state (Vishan`n`a). He was shining brightly, was having four large teeth.
The colour of his hairs was reddish brown (Pingala).
His eyes was of fire (Anila Ikshan`a).
This Purusha was called as Visha, as he made entire creatures
sorrowful / depressed. 
Thus, the Visha, literally called as poison, is
having aquatic origin (Ambu Sambhava).

This Visha was directed in to two types as
its origin  
1. Jangama
(coming from living beings)
2. Sthaavara
(any stationary or inanimate object, plant kingdom)

Visha manifests
with  

Asht`avega (effect
     of poison in eight stages) 
Das`hagun`a
     (having 10 qualities)
Chaturvims`hati Upakrama (24 procedures to pacify Visha)


As explained
earlier, being aquatic in origin, the Visha
becomes more powerful in rainy season (Varshaa
Ritu). Whereas in autumn (S`harad
Ritu) due to upcoming of the star Agasti,
the strength of Visha decreases.
