Sampraapti: 

The causative factors are responsible for the Vaata Prakopa in manifestation of Kaars`hya. 
Due to causative factors like Ati Vyaayaama etc., Rasa Dhaatu dries up; therefore
     next Dhaatu could not get the
     nourishment. 
Therefore, there is emaciation of the Dhaatu. 
Eventually, a person suffers from Kshudhaa, Pipaasaa, S`heeta, Ushn`a. 
As the person is debilitated, there is high
     risk of the diseases. Generally, an emaciated person suffers from Vaata Vikaara and Alpa Praan`a (gets weakened) also.
