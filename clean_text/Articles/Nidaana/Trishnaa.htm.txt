Causative factors:

In desiccation of a person,
     aggravated Vaata and Agni are the two most important
     factors, without them there can not be dryness in the body. 
In a person who baths with cold
     water, the hotness in the body gets obstructed and enters in to the Kosht`ha
     causing thirst. Therefore, when a
     person is hot should not get in to the cold water suddenly. 
Fear, hard physical work, depletion
     of physical strength causes accumulation of Pitta in the upper
     channels of the body. 


Sampraapti 

Due to the causative factors Vaata
     and Pitta are aggravated. 
They dry up the Dhaatu of Saumya attribute (Ap Dhaatu S`hoshan`a - dries up the
     water content in the body) such as Kapha,
     Rasa Dhaatu, Udaka. 
This Pitta gets associated
     with Vaata and harbours in Taalu (palate) manifesting
     thirst. That vitiates Udakavaha Srotas. 
There is drying of Rasavaha
     Srotas, Jihvaa Moola, Gala, Taalu, Kloma which manifests in the
     excessive thirst. 
As much water is drunk gets dried
     and the thirst is not pacified. 
In the pathogenesis of all types of
     Trishn`aa, Vaata and Pitta are responsible. 


Kaphajaa Trishn`aa 
Vaata and Agni both get obstructed by Kapha.
Kapha gets fried up resulting in Trishn`aa. The peculiar symptom of Kaphajaa
Trishn`aa is oedema on the limbs. 

According to Vaagbhat`a,
aggravated Kapha obstructs Vaata in Udakavaha Srotas. 

Kshatajaa Trishn`aa 
Due to blood
loss form the wound there is a thirst called as Kshatajaa Trishn`aa. 

Aamajaa Trishn`aa 
It is Aagneyaa
Trishn`aa. It is caused due to aggravation of Piitta due to obstruction
caused by Aama. According to Chakrapaan`i, it can be also named as Kaphajaa; as Aama is of
same symptoms of Kapha. 

Aamajaa
Trishn`aa is manifested
with the symptoms due to all the Dosha. There is aggravation of all the Dosha
due to Ajeern`a. 

Aamajaa
Trishn `aa is generally
caused due to aggravated Pitta and Vaata, therefore it is not
counted separately by Vaagbhat`a. 

Kshayajaa Trishn`aa 
Human body is
originated and sustained with Aahaara Rasa. This Aahaara Rasa
nourishes human body. When this Aahaara Rasa is depleted, the water
content in the body also gets depleted and a person becomes thirsty. 

Due to
depletion of Rasa Dhaatu, a person is desiccated and suffers from
burning sensation. He demands for more and more water. According to some, Kshayajaa
Trishn`aa is caused due to Sannipaata.
It manifests with the symptoms of RasaKshaya. 

Upasargajaa Trishn`aa

thirst appears as a complication of the diseases like Jvara, Prameha,
Kshaya, S`hvaasa etc. This is difficult to cure.
