with Rakta and vitiates it, smell and
color both are similar for Rakta and Pitta; because of all these reasons Pitta is denoted by Rakta.

Mythological origin Raktapitta 

In times of
yore, the fire of wrath of Lord Rudra aroused
during the destruction of Dakshas sacrifice.
The body and Praan`a of living beings got heated by this
fire. This resulted in the manifestation of Jvara
which is followed by Raktapitta. 

Sampraapti Event Description Raktapitta


1. 

Due to the indulgence in causative factors of Pitta, it gets aggravated. 
Rakta
     also increases substantially.
This aggravated Pitta in the substantially increased amount of Rakta (Blood) traverse through all
     over the body together.
It widens the openings of channels of Rakta Dhaatu due to oozing (Abhishyanda) (as Rakta exceeds its amount)
This aggravated Pitta obstructs these channels of Rakta Dhaatu, resulting in vitiation of Rakta. 

2. 


Because of the causative factors Pitta gets excited and reaches Rakta Dhaatu.
Pitta
     has its origin in Rakta. Therefore, when it reaches Rakta, it vitiates Rakta and Pitta. The result is further increase in Pitta volumetrically.
The combined heat and liquidity of Pitta and Rakta pervade the progressive Dhaatu_s one after
     the other, this results in further increase of fluidity which can not be
     contained by the respective cells, vessels. 

3. 


Due to the continuous
     indulgence in anger etc., Rasa
     gets vitiated. 
Vitiated Rasa Dhaatu excites Pitta (Pitta Prakopa) under the influence of anger.
This Pitta gets vitiated (Vidagdha),
     which with its properties like Teekshn`a
     etc. contaminates Rakta Dhaatu. 
This contaminated Rakta comes out of the body either
     through upper or lower or both the directions.

4.  

Pitta aggravated due
     to causative factors, with its liquidity (Drava), combines with Rakta.
This Pitta and Rakta became
     comparable in every aspect smell, Color,
     touch etc. Tulyaroopatvam
     Samavarn`atva A. H. Ni. 3/2)
They both collectively
     spread all over the body.
