Sampraapti:
1.
Aggravated
Vaayu vitiates Kapha, Rakta, Pitta after entering in to the
peripheral vessels (Baahya Siraa).
As a
result, the passage gets obstructed which spreads nearby causing swelling (Utsedha).
This is S`hotha.
Swelling
is the invariable characteristic feature of S`hotha. 
If Dosha,
afflict chest (Oordhva Sthaana), then the swelling appears at the
upper body. 
If Dosha
afflict lower part of the body, which is the location of Vaayu, then
swelling appears in the lower body part. 
If this
affliction take place in to the middle part of the body (between chest and the
pelvic region / Basti), then swelling occurs in the middle part of the
body. 
If this
affliction occurs all over the body then the swelling appears all over the
physique. 
If
however, these afflictions take place in the specific areas, then the swelling
appears locally and it is designated after the name of the body part where it
occurs.E.g. Gala S`hotha. 

2.
Due to
the aggravating factors, Dosha get aggravated.
These Dosha
in turn vitiate Dhaatu and S`hotha (S`hvayathu) gets
manifested all over the body. 

3.
Dosha situated in the Aamaas`haya
produces S`hotha at the upper side of the body; when situated in the Pakvaas`haya,
S`hotha manifested on middle of the body
When
these Dosha are situated in the Varchasthaana, S`hotha manifests
on the lower body
Whereas, Dosha
situated in the whole body cause S`hotha all over the body
It is Sarvasara.

4.
Vitiated Vaayu
vitiates Pitta, Rakta, Kapha traversing them to peripheral
vessels (Bahih Siraa).
These Dosha
settle down in to Tvak and Maamsa as Vaayu is
obstructed by Pitta, Rakta and Kapha. (Arun`a Datta A. H.
Ni.13/21)
A body
part at which this pathogenesis happens, nearby this stable, immovable swelling
gets appeared. 
This is S`hotha
due to all the three Dosha. 

Vaataja S`hotha 
Aggravated Vaayu
due to its increasing factors, vitiates Tvak, Maamsa and S`hon`ita,
then generates S`hotha. 

Pittaja S`hotha 
Pitta aggravated due to its increasing
factors, vitiates Tvak, Maamsa and S`hon`ita then generates S`hotha.


Kaphaja S`hotha 

Kapha aggravated due to its aggravating
factors, vitiates Tvak, Maamsa and S`hon`ita then generates S`hotha.
By
combinations of Vaataja, Pittaja and Kaphaja S`hotha, Dvandvaja
and Saannipaatika type of S`hotha are manifested. 
The causative
factors, signs and symptoms are same for S`hotha formed of respective Dosha.

Thus, by
considering all the combinations of Dosha in S`hotha, 7 types of S`hotha
are manifested. 
The
swelling which started of the feet and spreads all over the body in male, that
which starts of face and spreads all over the body in female, and that which
starts of perineum (Guhya Sthaana) in both male and female is very
difficult to cure.
