Introduction:
Bhagandara is laceration
of anal region (fistula). According to Sus`hruta
it is one of the Mahaavyaadhi. 

Nirukti:
Te Tu Bhaga Guda Basti

Bastim Tathaa Eva Cha |
Bhagam Daarayati Tasmaat Tat Dnyeyo
Bhagandarah || M. N. 46/1 Madhukos`ha

Whenever an Pid`akaa (abscess) formed at the sites
like perineal region (Bhaga), anal region (Guda) and bladder region (Basti)
bursts out after suppuration, it causes tearing of the skin making an opening
on the surface of skin, this is called as Bhagandara. 

Manifestation of
Bhagandara:
Due to Krimi, Asthi, Kshan`ana, Vyavaaya,
Pravaahan`a, Utkat`akaasana, there is manifestation of abscess (Pid`akaa) with excessive pain (Bhris`ha Arti) at the anal region. This Pid`akaa gets suppurated and bursts out,
which leads to Bhagandara. After
suppuration, the Pid`akaa is called
as Bhaagandaree Pid`akaa.

Types:
There are 5 types of Bhagandara according to Sus`hrita.
S`hataponaka
Usht`ragreeva

S`hambookaavarta
Unmaargee 

Doshabhedena:
Vaataja

If the Pid`akaa is not treated at proper time, this
leads to formation of Bhagandara. Bhaga,
