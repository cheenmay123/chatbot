bleeding. It is one of the popular methods for controlling bleeding.

on Maamsa also acts on Siraa,
Snaayu, Asthi, Sandhi, no separate Agnikarma need be performed
Marmasthaana is the absolute
contraindication for Agnikarma.

avoiding the Marmasthaana, Agnikarma of selected types like Bindu, Valaya, Rekhaa and
determining Dhaatu  Tvachaa, Maamsa etc. Dagdha should
be done. 

S.Su.12-12. 


* Effects of Aganikarma on the body:

Immediately after Dahana, Rakta and Pitta are vitiated chronologically. Agni and Pitta are of Ushn`a Veerya and
their Rasa is Kat`u. Dagdha increases
the intensity immediately, and depending on the site and size of Dagdha, burning pain, Jvara (pyrexia) and signs and symptoms
of Marmaaghaata develop.

At the site of Dagdha, there is formation of blister on the skin, and Maamsa and Snaayu get separated. This occurs either immediately or slowly. This
variation will depend on the size and depth of the burn and the region of the
body, e.g. mouth, chest and the area of burn 

S.Su. 12-17-18.


* Signs and Symptoms of Dagdha related to temperature and depth
of Dagdha:

Plusht`a Dagdha  Change in the color of the skin, which
becomes a little red. There is no formation of a blister but there is intense
burning. 


Treatment: 

Give a little fomentation. Due to Dagdha, there is coagulation of blood at
the site of the burn, which obstructs the flow of Vaayu (Vaayu becomes Aavritta). This results in stagnation of
heat at the site of the burn. Fomentation (hot) helps to liquefy the clotted
blood warmth results in vasodilatation, which opens the channels which release Vaayu ultimately, resulting in reduction
of swelling and the burning pain.

If we give cold fomentation there is more Skandana (coagulation) of blood creating
more and more obstructive pathology resulting in more Oedema, burning and pain.
This treatment is called Virudhaarthkaarin`ee Chikitsaa.

S.Su.12-16
and A.H.Su. 30- 47. and S.Su.12-20, 21 22 and Chakrapaan`i


Durdagdha:

There is formation of a blister with burning
and dragging (Chosha) sensation, inflamed
Oedema, redness and pain. These symptoms disappear in short time. 


Treatment:

It depends upon depth. If it is deep, give a
cold fomentation to allow the heated blood to go out. Here, cold acts as an antagonist.


If the burn is superficial give a hot fomentation to allow the
blood to liquefy.
Other treatment: Application of Ghrita, Lepa and Avasechana.
Some says that if there is severe burning, a cold fomentation
should be given and if the burning sensation is less, give a hot fomentation.
