Chikitsaa Prakaara: Anagni Sveda Bhaya





Chikitsaa Prakaara: Anagni
Sveda  Bhaya

Prakaara
Paribhaashaa:
This is a
type of Anagni Svedana.
Bhaya means panic / fear and due to this one gets sweating.

Chikitsaa Karma:
Panic results in Vaata Dosha
aggravation. Especially Vyaana Vaayu gets aggravated. This results in the increase of the rate of Rasa Vikshepan`a (increased blood
circulation) and leads to Srotomukha
Vikasana (widening openings of channels) and thus sweating.
