Introduction: 
Hikkaa is life threatening diseases due to obstruction of Vaata. It affect heart and debilitation of
Dhaatu.
It is mainly caused
due to Kapha Prakopa, Praan`a Vaayu Prakopa.
It is Madhyama
Maargagata and Pittasthaana
Samudbhava Vyaadhi.
The involved Srotasa
are Praan`avaha Srotas, Annavaha Srotas and Udakavaha Srotas.

Saamaanya
Chikitsaa:
Generally, Vaata
pacifying treatment should be carried out. If any complication occurs, then
also it remains treatable. S`hamana also does not cause much
complications; but if Kars`hana is carried out then if complications
occurs then they remain untreatable. Treatment
of S`hvaasa / Kaasa / Hikkaa / Kshaya / Chhardi could be done for Hikkaa.

S`hodhana - 
The first line of
treatment in S`hvaasa and Hikkaa is S`hodhana if the
patient is having good mental and physical strength. While administering any
type of S`hodhana precaution should be taken to avoid vitiation of Vaata
Dosha due to the medicine or due to complication of S`hodhana.

S`hamana and Brimhan`a  

S`hamana and Brimhan`a should be done for the
     weak, old patient, in children and also the patient having Vaata dominance, Anutklisht`a Kapha (no
     precipitation of Kapha Dosha) and Asvedya (patient
     unsuited for sudation)
S`hodhana should also be followed by S`hamana and
     Brimhan`a Chikitsaa.
Main factor in pathogenesis is Vaata
     Dosha, and it aggravates due to Karshan`a. Therefore first line
     of treatment consists of Brimhan`a or S`hamana which
     pacifies Vaata Dosha.
For this the medicines and diet,
     which are pacifying Kapha and
     Vaata Dosha, which are Vaataanulomaka, Agnideepaka and having Ushn`a property
     should be administered.
The medicines in the form of Avaleha
     and Siddha Sneha and food items like Yoosha and Maamsarasa
     should be administered.
The formulations which are useful
     in treating Paan`d`u Roga and S`hotha are also useful in
     treating S`hvaasa.
