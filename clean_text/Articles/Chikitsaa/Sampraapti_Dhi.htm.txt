Introduction:
Dhee, Dhriti and Smriti are types of Pradnyaa
(Wisdom / Intelligence).
Dhee is the power of reasoning.
Dhriti is the power of firmness, constancy.
Smriti is the power of recollection /
remembering.
Any derangement in these three leads to Pradnyaaparaadha
which is a main causative factor of many of the diseases. Many a times
these are not capable of producing diseases but remain in dormant phase. Its
better to treat the signs and symptoms at this level only to prevent disease
formation.
