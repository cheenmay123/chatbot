Treatment of Grahan`ee
according to Sus`hruta: (Su. U.
40/77 - 182)
As per the dominance
of the Dosha, the disease should be
treated. 
Paachaneeya, Deepaneeya, Sangrahan`eeya Gan`a are to be
administered early in the morning with Suraa
/ Arisht`a / Sneha / Mootra / Ushn`aambu / Takra
Everything that is Deepana should be used in Grahan`ee. 
Grahan`ee
is to be treated avoiding any contrast to the treatment of other concurrent
diseases. 
Treatment of Krimi, Gulma, Udara and Ars`ha is also to be adopted in this
disease named Grahan`ee.

Diet in Grahan`ee:
Diet should have Laghu, Deepaneeya, Ushn`a properties.
Peyaa
is advised to be used which is made up of Deepaneeya
Aushadha. 
If food is taken
after complete digestion of previously taken food, and if taken in amount which
can be digested easily, then it leads to perfect balance of Dhaatu. This increases life and health.
Otherwise, it leads to the imbalance of Dhaatu.


Role of Snehana
in Grahan`ee:
Sneha
is the best entity to enhance activity of Agni.
Very heavy diet also is unable to suppress the digestive activity of Agni, which is enhanced by Sneha. Any diet howsoever heavy is
unable to suppress Agni that is
kindled by Sneha
Therefore, it is necessary
to administer Sneha in Grahan`ee. Therefore Sneha enjoys a place of eminence in the
management of Grahan`ee.


Role of Takra (Buttermilk) in Grahan`ee:
Takra
is useful in diseases due to depletion of Agni
as Grahan`ee, Ars`ha, Udara. Takraarisht`a is also useful in this
disease. Due to following properties it is indicated in Grahan`ee.
