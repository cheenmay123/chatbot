Reference:
C.Chi.12,
S.Chi.8, A.H.U.28, N.R. Bhagandara

Introduction:
Bhagandara is anal fistula. Generally, while
treating Bhagandara, principles to
treat Vran`a should also be applied. 

Chikitsaa
Prior to
manifestation of Bhagandara, Bhagandari
Pit`ikaa appears. It is necessary to avoid suppuration in the Pit`ikaa. For this purpose, Rakta Sraava and Seka could be done. Then also, if the Pit`ikaa gets suppurated, then Snehana,
Svedana, Avagaaha Sveda should be done. 
Bhagandara should be treated with following
modalities:
Virechana

Eshan`a (to know the direction of the Bhagandara tract using probe)
Paat`ana 
When Bhagandara becomes clean (free from vitiated Dosha) with above four
Chikitsaa Karma, it is to be burnt / cauterized by using oil i.e. Taila Daaha
Ks`haarasootra should be used in Bhagandara management. 
When the
tract of Bhagandara is split open
with the Kshaara, it should be
treated like a Vran`a. 
If Bhaagandaree Pid`akaa is Apakva (not
perforated and without suppuration), then
it is to be treated with the procedures in following order
Apatarpan`a
Aalepa
Parisheka
Abhyanga

Sveda
Vimlaapana
Upanaaha
Paachana
Visraavan`a
Snehana
Vamana

should be examined with the procedure same as that of Ars`ha
Bhagandara
may be having opening internally or externally.

should be defined and in that direction, incision to be made.

If the Bhagandara tract is incised more than
once it may lead to widening the anus and even urine and stools may pass
through it. Repeated incisions vitiate Vaayu
which causes Guda S`hoola (pain in
ano rectal region), Aat`opa (gurgling
in the abdomen). Hence it is advisable to avoid repeated surgery. 
If anal
perforation or laceration occurs, it may lead to death. (Guda is a Praan`aayatana
and Sadyah Praan`ahara Marma)
