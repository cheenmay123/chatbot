C.Su.21, 24, 28, Vi.5, S. Sha.9 

Introduction:

All the changes
and transformations invariably take place in the Srotas (different channels)
in the human body. Srotas should be
maintained properly to maintain healthy status. Whenever any vitiation occurs
in the Srotas, they affect respective
process that is taking place in that particular Srotas. Hence consideration of Srotas
concept is necessary in treatment of any disease. 

Concept of Srotas:
Srotas is channel, which carries any transformable material. In this space,
the form of material gets converted into absorbable form. For example, consumed
food gets converted in to Aahaara Rasa
and Mala in Annavaha Srotas. 

Many Srotas are interlinked to each other.
Some Srotas accept Bhaava Padaartha (matter) from the
universe; some Srotas process them
and at the end some Srotas eliminate
the waste products which are formed from these metabolic processes. Annavaha Srotas, Praan`avaha Srotas, Udakavaha
Srotas accept food, Praan`a
(Ambarapeeyusha), water respectively. Whereas Rasavaha to S`hukravaha
Srotas process the accepted matter and convert them in to S`haareera Bhaava (attributes of human
body). This is the process of nourishment of all the Dhaatu, Indriya, Praan`a etc. 
Mootravaha, Pureeshavaha, Svedavaha Srotas  These Srotas throws out the excreta created by the metabolic processes.


If there is any
structural or functional vitiation of this Srotas,
then processes get affected, which in turn affects the further metabolic
processes leading to diseases or local pathology. Srotas related pathologies (Sroto
Dusht`i) can be grouped in four types:
Atipravritti (extra manifestation)
Sanga (obstruction)
Siraa
Granthi (glandular
growth)
Vimaargamana (movement through other Srotas)
