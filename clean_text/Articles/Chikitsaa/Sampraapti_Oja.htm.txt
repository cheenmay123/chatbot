Introduction:
Ojas
is a vital entity to maintain healthy and younger status. Ojas is an entity which provides the site to harbor the Praan`a. It is said to be one of the Praan`aayatana. 
Ojas
gets nourishment after digestion of food. Ultimately, maintenance of Ojas is dependent on Ojas nourishing food and its proper
digestion. Even if the food is having good nourishing qualities but not lacking
in digestive energy (Jaat`haraagni),
then also vitiation in the Ojas can
be seen. 
Ojas
has very close relation with Hridaya,
Manas, Indriya (especially Sense Organs i. e. Dnyaanendriyaan`i), all 7 Dhaatu
(especially Rasa and S`hukra Dhaatu) and the Chaitanya Sangraha. It is essence of all Dhaatu from Rasa to S`hukra. It is Saarabhaaga (ultimate essence) of all the Dhaatu; also it is described as Mala
or Upadhaatu of S`hukra. Thus, it is the purest and ultimate entity, which is
responsible to hold the Praan`a.
Rasa Dhaatu is also named as Ojas. 
Sus`hrutaachaarya has designated the strength of body to Ojas considering all these qualities. It is called as Bala. 

Properties of Ojas
Somaatmaka
(nourished by the moonlight)
Snigdha (unctuous) 
S`hukla (bright colored)
S`heeta (cold in nature)
Sthira (steady by its qualitative and quantitative aspect.
It does not get easily vitiated unless and until there is strong and long
lasting Sampraapti or Hetu Sevana to disturb its normal
physiology; therefore any vitiation in the Ojas
needs to be given proper attention so as to put it in its normal status)
Sara (moving and liquid in nature)
Vivikta (solitary entity though it is an ultimate essence
of all Dhaatu)
Mridu (soft in nature)
Mritsna (bright lustrous Chakahakaayamaana)
Madhura Svabhaavee (sweet in taste)

Signs of Ojas

Attributes of Ojas are seen in Kapha Prakriti. Those person are Ojasvee, S`haanta (calm and cool), Aayushmanta (having longer life). 
Aindra Sattva person have presence of all the attributes of Ojas, hence called as
Ojasvee. 
A person having equal
Aayaaama and Vistaara, is said to be Ojasvee.

Any qualitative
enrichment in the Ojas can be
inferred by the signs and symptoms observed on Hridaya, Manas, Indriya and all Dhaatu.


Types of Ojas:
Ayurveda explains two
types of Ojas: Para Ojas and Apara Ojas. 

Para Ojas:
The quantity of Para Ojas is 8 Bindu. It resides in the Hridaya.
It is highly pure (without any waste ingredient S`huddha). It is red in colour with yellow tinge (Raktam Ishat Sapeetakam). This Para Ojas is responsible for
continuation of life; therefore it is called as Praanaas`hraya Ojas. 

Whenever, there is
depletion of this Para (Great) Ojas, it is the indication of death
which reflects in form of Arisht`a
Lakshn`a described in Indriyasthaana
of Charaka Samhitaa. Therefore, one
can infer that unless and until there is vitiation of Para Ojas, the Arisht`a
Lakshan`a can not be manifested. 

Apara Ojas:
Whereas, Apara Ojas is Anjalee in quantity and resides in the Hridaya and Hridayastha
10 Dhamanee. All these Dhamanee carries Ojas which is having qualities same as Rasa (Rasaatmaka).
Whenever there is vitiation in Apara Ojas,
it is treatable and curable; but as explained earlier vitiation in Para Ojas is a sign for death which
reflects in terms of Arisht`a. 


Ojovikriti
The vitiation in this Apara Ojas happens in three ways:
Ojas
Kshaya (decrease in terms of
quantity)
Ojas
Visramsa (falling asunder,
dropping down, relaxation, weakness of Ojas)
Ojas
Vyaapad (derangement in terms of
quality of Ojas)
(Ojas - Kshaya, Visramsa
and Vyaapad are also termed as Bala - Kshaya, Visramsa and Vyaapad respectively as Ojas is also considered as Bala.)

Causative factors for Oja Kshaya and Ojo Visramsa

Abhighaata
(trauma)
Kshaya
(depletion in body tissues) 
Kopa
(anger)
Dhyaana
(mental representation at one subject)
S`hrama (exertion)
Kshudhaa
(hunger)
Ativyavaaya 
Anas`hana

S`hoka
In the 8th
month of pregnancy, Sthira Gun`a of Ojas is not established completely;
therefore it is moving from baby to mother and mother to baby; so this is not
the proper month for delivery. If Ojas
resides in mother, then mother remains fresh and vice versa.
