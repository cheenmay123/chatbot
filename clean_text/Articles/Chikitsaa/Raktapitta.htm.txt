Introduction:
This is an acute disease (Aas`hukaaree). It spreads like forest
fire. It should be treated immediately and carefully. When this disease changes
the course (direction) it is indicative of incurability (Asaadhyatva). It is a serious disease (Mahaagada), having grave consequences. It afflicts the patient very
fast. Mahaavega - greatly agitated). It is like fire and
affects instantaneously (Agnivat S`heeghrakaaree)


Pitta
is associated with Rakta; hence it
has a natural tendency to vitiate. This vitiated Pitta combines with Rakta
and contaminates it. Pitta and Rakta have comparable smell and colour.
Owing to this relationship in this Vyaadhi
Pitta is addressed as Rakta. 


Saamanya Chikitsaa 

Raktapitta
is of three types  
Oordhvaga which is Kaphaanubandhee
and is Saadhya 
Adhoga which is Vaataanubandhee
and Yaapya 
Tiryak which is Asaadhya.

Note: - Pratimaarga (Viruddha) Maarga Haran`a (S`hodhana): Eliminating the causative,
vitiated Dosha from the opposite
direction of its manifestation is the key to management of Rakta Pitta. 
(For Oordhvaga Raktapitta Kashaaya
and Tikta Rasa are criteria for S`hamana Dravya and Madhura Rasa is for Adhoga
Raktapitta.)

Oordhvaga Raktapitta: - 

The causative attributes
are Snigdha and Ushn`a which vitiate the combination of Kapha and Pitta resulting
in Oordhvaga Rakta Pitta. To eliminate from the opposite Maarga, Virechana is the modality of choice; which is the best S`hodhana for Pitta and for Kapha too.
Hence Oordhvaga Rakta Pitta is Saadhya / Curable. Out of the three Rasa_s owing to Kapha involvement
Madhura is contraindicated; which
leaves Kashaaya and Tikta for S`hodhana which are abundantly available, thus the choice is wide,
hence it is Saadhya.

Adhoga Raktapitta: - 

Vamana is
the modality of choice as per Pratimaarga
Haran`atenet. The attributes are Rooks`ha and Ushn`a; which cause vitiation of Vaata and Pitta. The
available taste for S`hodhana is only
Madhura. The availability for Madhura Vamana dravya is limited as well as S`hamana with Madhura Rasa too
is limited. Vamana is not a treatment
of choice for Pitta as well as Vaata. This makes Adhoga Rakta Pitta Yaapya / incurable but controllable with
diet and regimen.

Tiryak Raktapitta: - 

When all three Dosha_s are simultaneously vitiated and
are circulating in the blood stream, the manifestation is subcutaneous, which
does not respond to either Vamana or Virechana as the Dosha_s are in the S`haakha Maarga,
owing to the amount of the Dosha_s it
becomes impossible to bring them in the Kosht`ha
for elimination. There is limited number of drugs available to manage this
condition. The patient may be Durbala
due vitiation of all the three Dosha_s
and Rakta, all of them being Pran`aayatana_s. All these factors taken
together render the condition incurable.

Description: 
State of Upeks`haa
Since Raktapitta is a bleeding disorder initially in person who is not
weak and if only vitiated Dosha_s are
flowing out, then no attempt should be made to arrest the bleeding as untimely
arrest invariably leads to complications like Paan`d`u (anemia), Grahan`ee
(Intestinal motility disorder), Kusht`ha
(Resistant skin diseases), Prameha
(Urinary tract and system disorders), Gulma
(Solitary lump in abdomen) and Jvara
(Pyrexia / fever) etc.

bleeding disorder is exhibiting one or more of the following he should be
subjected to palliative mode of treatment immediately without delay 

weakness (Ksheen`a
Bala),
wasting / reduced power of muscle tissue (Ksheen`a Maamsa), 
emaciated by grief (S`hoka Kars`hita),
carrying heavy load (Bhaara Kars`hita), or 
walking for long time and distance (Adhva Kars`hita),

     diseases (Kshee`nam Aamayaih), 
Pregnant/ expectant woman (Garbhin`ee), 
Child under sixteen years (Baala), 
having habit of consuming dry food (Rooks`haanabhuk) or
consume food in less quantity (Alpaas`hana) or 
taking food at less times (Pramitaas`hana), 
who is
     not suitable for Vamana or Virechana (S`hodhana Anarha )and
who is suffering from S`hosha ( Tuberculosis or wasting disease leading to
     progressive weight loss)

Should be treated by S`hamana Therapy. 
 

S`hamana

By examining Langhanaarha
and Brimhan`aarha, Tikta and Kashaaya Rasa substances
should be used for S`hamana Therapy
in Oordhvaga Raktapitta. 

Langhanaaraha persons should be administered Tikta (Bitter) and Kashaaya (Astringent) substance while Brimhan`eeya persons should be administered Madhura (Sweet) substances, in case sweet tasting substances is not
available a substances having sweet post digestive taste (Madhura Vipaaka) should employed.

Madhura
Rasa substances should be used for
Adhoga Raktapitta.
Vaasaa
is the S`hamana drug of choice in Rakta Pitta. 



State
     of Langhana in S`hamana


The state of Upekshaa is assisted by Langhana
(Fasting which could be complete fasting to restricted food intake in the form
of Tarpan`a). By examining the Dosha_s (Dominant Dosha), Avasthaa (Oordhvaga or Adhoga or Tiryak), Saatmya
(homologation) and Anubandha
(associated Dosha) fasting should be
done by consuming Tarpan`a.

If Raktapitta
is Oordhvaga, fasting is assisted by
consuming Tarpan`a and if it is Adhoga fasting is done with consuming Peyaa, Yavaagoo etc. to control Vaata.

After adequate fasting Sus`hruta
advises the person to consume Peyaa
with a little rice. 

The Rasa
and Yoosha prepared by using
Aromatic drugs and Sneha (oil or
Ghee) are also suggested.

Tarpan`a,
Paachana, Avaleha
and medicated ghee are also advised as per the condition and indication.

The monitoring and protection of the
persons physical power and mental strength is emphasized by Vagbhat`a
throughout the management. 


S`hodhanaarha Avasthaa

 A person
suffering from Raktapitta exhibits
aggravated Dosha_s, good strength and
power, without muscular wasting and whose condition has arisen out of Santarpan`a, who can withstand S`hodhana and is devoid of complications
should always be treated by S`hodhana.



S`hodhana Pas`hchaat
     Samsarjana Krama

In a strong person suffering from Oordhvaga Raktapitta after Purification the sequence of food should
consuming Tarpan`a and in case of Adhoga Raktapitta it should consist of Peyaa, Yavagoo etc. to establish control
over Vaata activity. 



Mandaagni + Amla Rasa Saatmya

If
the person suffers from Mandaagni and
likes sour things to eat he should be given Tarpan`a
prepared with sour substance which is not only harmless but also beneficial
to him.


Trishn`aa

The
S`hritas`heeta Jala medicated with Tikta (bitter) drugs as well as fruit
juices are suggested for Trishn`aa.
By examining Dosha_s, Bala (Physical capacity) and Aahaara (food consumption) water can be
given in small quantity and at small time intervals in Trishn`aa.


Grathita Rakta Avasthaa: -


In this
condition clotting of blood occurs. Due to intermittent bleeding clots are seen
in excreted blood. Excreta of pigeon (Paaraavata
S`hakrit) mixed with appropriate Anupaana
is used as medicine.

Ati Nihsrita Rakta /
Ati Raktasraava: -
  This condition can happen in any type of Raktapitta due to extremely aggravated
intensity and heat of both Rakta and Pitta. In this condition medicine in the
form of medicated Ghee as well as fresh blood with honey is advised to be taken
internally.

Udeern`a
Raktapitta: -
This
is an acute disease and affects instantaneously like fire in terms of spread,
causing damage and acuteness. The decoction of Rakta Stambhaka drugs
should be used to treat Udeern`a Raktapitta. 

Note: - The above given conditions can occur irrespective
of the type and Dosha Praadhaanya. The following are the
conditions which occur in any of the type of Raktapitta.

Oordhvaga
Raktapitta: 
Oordhvaga Raktapitta is Saadhya type of Raktapitta. It is Kaphaanubandhi.

Oordhvaga
Raktapitta: 

Kan`t`hagata

Kaphaanubandha
+ Sapichchha + Grathita Rakta: - 
In this condition bleeding
occurs from throat. The expectorated blood is found to be sticky due to mucous
strands (Sa Pichchha), and along with
clots (Grathita Rakta). Ks`haara is used in this condition
though they are normally contraindicated. Ks`haara
of Kamalanaala is used in this
condition.


Naasaagata

Avapeed`a Nasya of Raktapitta Naas`haka drugs is the procedure of choice.
This is given only when vitiated Dosha_s
are excreted.
To combat the effects of
excessive bleeding use of fresh blood internally is advised as well as fresh
goats liver is also advised to be consumed. Cold and Sweet substances should
be used to treat Naasaagata Raktapitta. 

Threat in treating Naasaagata Raktapitta
If bleeding is arrested
when blood is still vitiated it produces Dusht`a
Pratis`hyaaya, S`hiroroga, the smell of blood coming out from the nose
resembles Pus or foul smell, power of smelling gets diminished / perception of
smell is affected and Dusht`a Krimi
appears in nose / the nose may exhibit presence of worm infestation in the
later stages.

Guidelines for Oordhvaga
Raktapitta (which doesnt get pacified): 
Even after improved Agni, annihilation
of Kapha, if bleeding persists then it is considered to be due to Vaata. Hence the management should aim
at establishing normal flow of Vaata
along its channels (Vaataanulomana).Vaataghna treatment should be done and Ksheerapaaka is the drug of choice for
such condition. 

Adhoga Raktapitta: -
This is Yaapya (remains controlled as long as
the treatment is going on  palliative) type of Raktapitta. In this Vaata
is Anubandhi / associated Dosha. In this type bleeding occurs from
Mootra Maarga (Urethra), Guda
(per rectum), and Yoni (per vaginum)
in females.
This should be
differentiated from Raktaatisaara, Raktaja Ars`ha, Rakta Pradara like
disorders resembling Adhoga Raktapitta.



Vaatolban`a Raktapitta

Vibandha Avasthaa


Vibandha
is a condition found in Vaata Pradhaana Raktapitta in which MaamsaRasa
is the medicine of choice.


Mootra Maargagata

Rujaa


Ks`heerapaaka is the drug of choice according to Charaka and Vaagbhat`a. Sus`hruta suggests Uttarabasti
for managing this condition. 


Gudagata

Since
the sign and symptoms are similar to Raktaatisaara
and Raktaja Ars`ha, their treatment also shows similarity. According to
Sus`hruta it should be treated by the medicines used in Raktaatisaara. In Raktasraavee Ars`ha treatment of Raktapitta
can be used and vise versa. 
Vaagbhat`a
adds Basti as the procedure of choice
for this condition
