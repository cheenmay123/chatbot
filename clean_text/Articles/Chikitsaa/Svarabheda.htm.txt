are as follows -

Raktaja and 
Sannipaataja.

Svaroopa Svarabheda Chikitsaa:
In Charaka Samhitaa and Asht`aanga Hridaya, treatment of Svarabheda is given in two different

Difference between the treatments of
these two types of Svarabheda:

While treating Svarabheda Vyaadhi, S`hodhana has been given more emphasis as compare to when it
     is associated with Raajaykshmaa. (
     where S`hamana has been given more importance)
Since in Raajayakshmaa, the line of treatment is to improve the
     strength of the patient, Ghrita
     preparations are used extensively in treating Svarabheda also.
