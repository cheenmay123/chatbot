Introduction 
According to Sus`hruta, S`hosha is a disease which is of high severity and is difficult to diagnose and
eliminate. Before manifesting it is preceded by many diseases and after
manifestation many diseases follow it.

Definition

It is known as S`hosha
because it dries up Rasa etc. Dhaatu. It also reduces various
functions in the body and hence called as Kshaya. Other people call it as Raajayakshmaa
as this disease affected the Moon  the king of
celestial bodies and constellations (Naks`hatra).
Vaagbhat`a
however interprets that as it is the king (chief) of diseases so it is known as
Raajayakshmaa. This disease wants attention equivalent to a
king hence the name Raajayakshmaa

According to Sus`hruta, in all the seven types of S`hosha, all the symptoms of Raajayakshmaa caused by three Dosha do not reflect hence these should
be treated as Kshaya due to wasting
of Dhaatu (Dhaatukshaya)

Even though these seven
categories show some commonality with Raajayakshamaa
wasting of some Dhaatu; they differ
in some aspects. Hence, Sus`hruta
prefers to describe them as S`hosha.
