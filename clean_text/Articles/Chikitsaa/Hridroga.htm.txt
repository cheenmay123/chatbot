Introduction:
Hridroga is disease involving the heart. It is of five
types as follows:
Vaataja
Pittaja
Kaphaja
Saannipaatika
Krimija

Precautions:
Heart is one of
the Marma and requires special
attention when get afflicted. It is Sadyah
Praan`ahara Marma, which is a vital part causing death immediately if
afflicted by either vitiated Dosha or
extrinsic factors like trauma. Though S`hodhana
therapy is not contraindicated in heart diseases, there are some situations
where these are advised with taking proper care of the heart and the patient.
Generally Panchakarma - S`hodhana therapies are not advised but Samhitaa advise use of S`hodhana before commencing S`hamana Chikitsaa. It is imperative
that the patient should be monitored closely during the procedure.

S`hodhana in
Hridroga:
Vaataja Hridroga
Vamana is advised by Sus`hrutaachaarya.
Pittaja Hridroga Vamana and
Virechana both are advised.
Kaphaja Hridroga also Vamana and Virechana are advised.

All these
procedures should be done with care as Marmaaghaata

stress caused during these procedures or by Atiyoga
(excessive purification) or Mithyaa
Yoga (imperfect purification) of these procedures.

Vaataja Hridroga is mainly caused due to Vimood`ha
     Vaata therefore treatment of Vimood`ha
     Vaata is done taking care of heart.

     is contra indicated in Hridroga,
     in Vaataja Hridroga it is
     indicated as it is site of Kapha
     . It should be performed with care and continuous monitoring the status of
     patient.
Basti is
     the best S`hodhana Therapy for Vaata, hence it is also advised by Sus`hrutaachaarya.

sesame for three days prior to Virechana.

by Virechana.
After Virechana, Vid`anga should be used extensively as medicine and in food also.
