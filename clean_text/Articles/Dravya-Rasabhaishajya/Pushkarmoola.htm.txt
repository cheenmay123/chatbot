Introduction: Cardiac diseases are one of the chronic diseases, which
are getting more common in the developed countries. The first clinical symptom
of this disease is Dyspnea followed
by angina on exercise. Ayurveda has
an edge in this field. There are several medicinal plants, which have been
described as Hridya (For cardiac
care) in Ayurvedic texts and one of
them is Inula racemosa, which
is described here.


Inula racemosa Hook
F. belongs to the family Compositae. Its Sanskrit Name is Pushkaramoolam, in Hindi it is Pushkaramoola
or Pokharamoola and in English it
is named as Oris root. Other regional
names are Pushkaram, Paushkaram, Pushkara Jat`aa, Kashiram,
Padmavarnakam, Moolam, Padman, Padma Patrakam, S`hvaasari, Pushkara Moola,
Penva, Pokharamoola, Poshkara, Rasana, Gharsa, Pokarrumoolam (1). It is a tall, stout
herb. Stem 0.3-1.5 meters high, rough, grooved, leaves leathery, rough above
densely hairy beneath. Basal leaves 20-45 cms, long stalked, elliptic lance-shaped, stem leaves oblong
half-stem-clasping, often deeply lobed at the base. Heads many, very large,
3.8-5 
cms diameter in racemes. Outer bracts
broad, tips triangular, bent back, inner bracts liner, sharp pointed. Lingules slender, 1.3 cms long. Fruit (Achene) 4cms long slender, hairless. Pappus 8 cms long reddish (2).


As per the Ayurvedic
text it is used as S`hvaasahara and Hikkaanigrahan`a (Charaka). Due to its Ushn`a
Veerya nature, it is Kapha  Vaata S`haamaka. It possesses Gun`a as Laghu, Teekshn`a, Rasa
as Tikta, Kat`u, Veerya as Ushn`a and Vipaaka as Kat`u. Pushkaramoola is very useful for Hikkaa, S`hvaasa, Hridroga, Paars`hvas`hoolaa, Hridayas`hoola, Kaasa, Kshaya, Jeern`a Jvara, S`hopha, Paan`d`u etc. as
described in various classical Ayurvedic texts
as given below. It is also recommended for bronchial asthma cough hiccup etc
(3).


Pure Phytochemical,
especially steroidal compound with melting point 149-152, Daucosterol, 3 Sesquiterpine, Lactone e.g. Dihydro-Iso-Alanto-Lactone,
Iso-Alantolactone (major
portion) and Alantolactone have been isolated from the underground
part of Inula racemosa. The
last one was reported to be less toxic than other Phytochemicals (4-6).
In South India, Malabar variety of Pushkaramoola is used as a substitute for the North
Indian Pushkaramoola, which contains a high amount of essential oil and
a group of Sesquiterpenses called Alantoides and a high
yield of Octadecanoic acid, d-Maniitol, Iso-Alantolactone, and beta-Sistosterols, Glucosides were
isolated from this extract, (7). It also contains Insulin 10% a volatile oil
(1.3%) and Alantolactones (C15H20O2)
in oil (5).


Pushkaramoola has been found to reduce blood
sugar in rabbits with glucose induced Hyperglycemia (8). It has reported to reduce serum
cholesterol (9). In rats, the petroleum ether extract of roots of I. racemosa lowered plasma insulin and glucose
levels within 75 min of oral administration and it significantly counteracted
adrenaline  induced Hyperglycemia in rats (10) Its alcoholic extract
lowered blood glucose and enhanced liver glycogen without increasing plasma
insulin in rats. There was no increase in degree of de-granulation of the beta
cells of pancreas indicating its action on the target tissue, suggested that
its hypoglycemic response was not due to enhanced secretion/synthesis of
insulin but by enhanced insulin sensitivity (11) In similar conditions it does
not show any effect on activity of adrenal gland. However the thyroid gland
undergoes activation at a later stage (delayed response) 11. Other scientist
has also reported the hypoglycemic effects of I. racemosa through inhibition in corticosteroid concentration 12. In a separate study it lowered the raised
concentration of both cortisol and glucose in the serum and inhibits
lipid-peroxidation 13. Although it was not effective in
thyroid hormone meditated type II diabetes, but it enhanced the insulin
sensitivity in an animal model (14, 15).


The extract of Inula
racemosa showed negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects on a frogs heart showing its
blocking activity for beta-Adrenergic receptors. Results were comparable with
propranolol (10, 16) It showed reversal in the changed parameters of rats,
where myocardial infarction was induced experimentally by isprenaline injection specially increased level of circulating GOT, LDH, CPK,
CAMO, cortisol, pyruvate, lactate glucose and cardiac
Camp adenyl cyclase. The
results were comparable to that of ciplar,
a standard beta blocker (9).


It showed potential Cardio
protective benefits in
different human trials. With Pushkara
Guggula, a ply herbal formulation, it is significantly protected the
exercise induced ECG changes in a 3 months open clinical trial study on 50
patients with confirmed diagnosis of IHD with score of 10% cure, 60% with 60%
relief and 20% with improved and 10% with unchanged symptoms (17-18). Another
experimental study showed the prevention of ST-segment depression and T-wave
inversion in the post-exercise electrocardiogram of the patients treated with Inula racemosa root powder (10,19). In combination with Commiphora mukul, it was found to be superior to that of
nitroglycerin in reducing the chest pain and dysponea associated
with angina (20-22).


Its Aqueous and alcoholic extract showed potent
ant-5-HT and antihistaminic leading to anti-allergic properties (23). It
prevented the mast cell degranulation and was effective against type I
hypersensitivity, viz. egg
albumin induced passive cutaneous
anaphylaxis (PCA) in albino
rats (24) alantone (50mg/kg of the body weight daily
during 30 days) has shown the increase in number and level of maturity of
peritoneal and mesenteric mast cells and decreased blood clotting, thus
improving the peripheral blood circulation and microcirculation (25).


The alcoholic extract of the roots of Inula racemosa shoed anti-dermatophytic and cholinergic activities
(26). isoalantoactone arrested the spread of human pathogenic
fungi especially aspergillus flavus,
A. niger, geotrichum candidum, candida
tropicalis and C. albicans (6) In-vitro anti-fungal activity of alantolactone and iso-alantolactone against two ringworm fungi was reported. The response was
comparable with nystain but inferior
from amphotericin. alanolactone showed antihelmenthic activity against earthworms and
tapeworms is an antiseptic, expectorant and diuretic (27)
