The
procedure by which Vilayana or Dravikaran`a (liquefaction) of Dusht`a Tvak and Maamsa and also
removal of the same is achieved with the help of Kshaara is called as Kshaarakarma.

It becomes
imperative in certain conditions to physically remove the sloughs, Dusht`a Tvak (contaminated) skin or hypertrophic muscles from a wound or a
lump, at such places Kshaarakarma should
be done. 

Types:
Prtisaaran`eeya Kshaara is again divided into three types viz. 
Mridu,
Madhyama and 
Teekshn`a.

Poorvakarma (Prerequisites):
Medicine preparation:
Madhu, Kaanjee, Dadhi, Dadhi Mastu, Lepa of S`heetaveerya Dravya, Tila Kalka, Yasht`i, Ghrita, Amla Varga, Sauveeraka, Tushodaka, Dhaanyaamla

Pradhaanakarma:
The procedure should be conducted inside a room free from excessive wind
flow and sunlight.
The person should be given a position according to the disease.
The area around the site of Kshaarakarma
should be covered by a cloth.
For Pittaja diseases Gharshan`a (rubbing), for Vaataja diseases, Kathin`a and Supta Tvak Lekhana
(scrapping) for Kaphaja diseases and
when excessive Kan`d`oo and S`hotha is present then Prachchhaana Karma should be done before application of Kshaara.
Then Kshaara should be applied
with the help of S`halaakaa.
Kshaara should be
washed off after a time required calculating 100 numbers. (For Kshaara karma at Mridu organs the time should be that equal to calculate 50
numbers.)
The site should be covered by a Plota
/ palm.

Pas`hchaatkarma: 
The site of Kshaarakarma should
be flushed with drugs from Amlavarga.

Then Lepa of solid part from Sauveeraka, Tushodaka etc. or Tila, Yasht`i should be applied at the site of
Kshaarakarma.
The patient should be given Abhishyandi
Aahaara e.g. Dadhi, Maasha. Due to
this there is formation of Kleda at
the site of Kshaarakarma and Vilayana of Maamsaadi Dhaatu resulting
in Ksharan`a (destruction) of Dhaatu.
